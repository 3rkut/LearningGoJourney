# Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to  My Learning Golang Journey

<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malwarehenri/LearningGoJourney/main/img/go.jpg" /></p>


Hello, I just created this repo for follow my Learning Golang Journey and uploading examples of my codes.
I just started with basic examples.

# Which sites / sources do I learn from?

Basicly, [The Official Golang Site](https://golang.org/doc/).
It's great tutorial. Also have [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) 
You can quickly check and and you can compare it with other programming languages.

## And other good books:

- [Hands-On Go Programming: Explore Go by solving real-world challenges](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Go-Programming-real-world-challenges/dp/1789531756)
- [Go Programming Language, The (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)
- [Network Programming with Go: Learn to Code Secure and Reliable Network Services from Scratch](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programming-Go-Adam-Woodbeck/dp/1718500882)
- [Black Hat Go: Go Programming For Hackers and Pentesters](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Go-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593278659)

# How often will it be updated?

Really I don't know. I will update it as I learn and practice. 

### 17.04.2021 update!
- I am studying slowly because I want to learn well the concepts of GOLANG.
- Currently working on Lesson9: MULTILINGUAL TEXT. (Page:73/88)

#### Some notes about lesson9:
- Escape sequences like \n are ignored in raw string literals (`).
- Strings are immutable. Individual characters can be accessed but not altered.
- Strings use a variable length encoding called UTF-8, where each character con-sumes 1â€“4 bytes.
- A byte is an alias for the uint8 type, and rune is an alias for the int32 type
- The range keyword can decode a UTF-8 encoded string into runes.

### 18.04.2021 update!
- Lesson 9 is done.
Now I'm in Lesson 10: CONVERTING BETWEEN TYPES.(Page:84/99)
- Currently studying in this book: [Get Programming with GO (Nathan Youngman, Roger Peppe)](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Programming-Go-Nathan-Youngman/dp/1617293091)

### 19.04.2021 update!
- Lesson 10 is done.
Now I'm in UNIT 3 , Lesson 12 : Functions.(Page:93/108)


### Some Notes About Lesson10:
- Conversion between types is explicit to avoid ambiguity.
- The strconv package provides functions for converting strings to and from other types.
- And also SPrintf.

# My future plans and TODOS:

- Learn Windows APIs in Golang,
- Do some examples with Winapi,
- Try to write some basic vx things with it.
