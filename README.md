Hello, I just created this repo for follow my Learning Golang Journey and uploading examples of my codes.
I just started with basic examples.

# Which sites / sources do I learn from?

Basicly, [The Official Golang Site](https://golang.org/doc/).
It's great tutorial. Also have [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) 
You can quickly check and and you can compare it with other programming languages.

## And other good books:

- [Hands-On Go Programming: Explore Go by solving real-world challenges](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Go-Programming-real-world-challenges/dp/1789531756)
- [Go Programming Language, The (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

# How often will it be updated?

Really I don't know. I will update it as I learn and practice. 

### 17.04.2021 update!

# My future plans and TODOS:

- Learn Windows APIs in Golang,
- Do some examples with Winapi,
